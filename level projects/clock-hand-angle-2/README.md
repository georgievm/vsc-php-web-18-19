# 🕑 ClockHandAngle2

You've been staring at the clock, thinking about the clockHandAngle challenge you've solved recently. You're wondering how long it will take the hands to reach an given angle, so you want to write an algorithm to return the time the angle happens counted from the present time.

Given an angle in degrees and the present time timeNow (in the form of hh:mm:ss). Your task is to find the next time when the hour and minute hands form the angle. Return the time rounded down to the nearest second.

Go to the directory where all programs for the web pages will be stored.

For xampp (default location):
```bash
cd C:\xampp\htdocs

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://link-to-project
```

Go to the project directory

```bash

Enter "*localhost*" in the search bar of your favourite web browser.

Navigate to the project folder.

Voilà! 👌
